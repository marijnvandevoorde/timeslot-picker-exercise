# This is a quick & dirty implementation of a timeslot picker using the DateTime picker from Atlassian's design system. So all credits to them:
https://atlassian.design/components/datetime-picker/time-picker/

The main reason this repo exists is to provide an application to candidates for job interviews. 
The code is dirty, there are a few bugs in it, but they are (probably) intentional.
